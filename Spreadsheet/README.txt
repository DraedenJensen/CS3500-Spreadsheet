# Comments to Evaluators:

This documentation was originally created for assignment 4, but it has been updated for assignment 5. References 1 and 2
listed below were used for assignment 4, the rest were used for assignment 5.

# Assignment Specific Topics

No additional information is required.

# Consulted Peers:

I used the advice of Christian Hartman on Piazza to help me implement the nested Cell class for assignment 4. For
assignment 5, I got the help of lots of peers. Surbhi Saini was very helpful with understanding multiple aspects of the 
specifications. Chase Harkcom helped me knowwhat to do with the Changed property, because I was unfamiliar with the
get/protected set syntax. Adrian Regaldo clarified how to implement the normalization function in my Spreadsheet, which 
was very useful. Matthew Williams taught me how to deal with versions while saving/building Spreadsheet objects. Finally, 
I discussed the assignment with John Haraden, and I found it helpful to just talk over the assignment specifications with him.
