# Comments to Evaluators:

This work stands on its own.

# Assignment Specific Topics

No additional information is required.

# Consulted Peers:

I did not consult any peers on this assignment. With the detailed API and relatively simple project specifications, 
there was no point at which I felt this was necessary.
